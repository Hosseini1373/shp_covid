# Swiss Household Panel Analysis

Welcome to the Swiss Household Panel Analysis project. This project is a collaborative effort by a group of students, aimed at analyzing the Swiss Household Panel (SHP) Dataset up until the year 2021. Our main research question is to understand the factors associated with changes in general life satisfaction since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The dataset we used can be found here (https://forscenter.ch/projects/swiss-household-panel).
### Research Question

Welche Faktoren stehen mit einer Ver√§nderung der allgemeinen Lebenszufriedenheit seit Beginn der Verbreitung von Covid-19 in Beziehung?
(Translation: Which factors are associated with changes in general life satisfaction since the beginning of the spread of COVID-19?)
Repository Structure

#### The repository consists of the following main components:

    output: This directory contains all the graphs that are generated as part of this analysis.

    Data_Preprocessing.R: This R script file is located in the main directory. It contains the preprocessing steps required to read the data and prepare it for analysis.

    Report.Rmd: This R Markdown file is also located in the main directory. It contains markdown for creating the analysis plots which compile into Report.pdf. The graph images are located in the output directory. For a detailed report on this project, please refer to Report.pdf.

#### How to Use

    Clone this repository or download the files.
    Ensure that you have R installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from here.
    Open Data_Preprocessing.R in R or an R supporting IDE and execute the script. This will process the data needed for the analysis.
    Open Report.Rmd and knit it to create the analysis report (Report.pdf).
